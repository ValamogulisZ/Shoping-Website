# For Further Development
All items and users in my shoping website are defaultly stored in sqlite file which is created by setup_database.py
Even though I made a simple function that allow you to sign up new users, to modify the items information, you have to modify the file of setup_database.py. We could extend more functions to for administrator to manage information of items.
